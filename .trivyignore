# DS002: Image user should not be 'root'
# JUSTIFICATION: FastMCP Runner requires root during init to:
#   1. Authenticate to container registries (crane auth)
#   2. Extract OCI image filesystem to system paths
#   3. Set proper ownership on extracted files
# The entrypoint.sh immediately drops privileges to non-root user (uid 1000)
# via su-exec BEFORE running the MCP server. See Dockerfile SECURITY MODEL.
